# Superpowers Brainstorming Skill for QuanForge

## Trigger
Activates before writing code or implementing features.

## Purpose

## Workflow

### 1. Clarify the Goal
- What problem are we solving?
- Who is the user/stakeholder?

### 2. Explore Alternatives
- What are 2-3 different approaches?
- Pros and cons of each
- Which aligns best with existing codebase patterns?

### 3. Design Validation
Break design into sections:
- **Architecture**: How components/services interact
- **Data Flow**: How data moves through the system
- **User Experience**: UI/UX considerations
- **Technical Constraints**: Performance, security, compatibility

### 4. Decision Documentation
Save design decisions with:
- Chosen approach and rationale
- Rejected alternatives and why
- Implementation notes
- Testing strategy
