# Development Agent Guidelines

## Agent Insights & Decisions

### Build System Compatibility (2025-12-18)
**Issue**: Node.js crypto module incompatibility with browser builds  
**Root Cause**: `utils/enhancedRateLimit.ts` imported server-side `crypto` using `createHash`  
**Solution Applied**: Browser-compatible simple hash algorithm  
**Key Insight**: Always verify cross-platform compatibility when importing Node.js modules in frontend code

### Vercel Deployment Schema Issues (2025-12-18)
**Issue**: Multiple `vercel.json` schema validation errors blocking deployments  
**Root Causes**: 
- Conflicting `builds` and `functions` properties
- Invalid `experimental` and `environment` properties  
- Legacy configuration patterns
**Solution Applied**: Cleaned up vercel.json with schema-compliant settings
**Key Insight**: Deployment platform schemas evolve - remove deprecated properties proactively

### PR Management & Red Flag Resolution (2025-12-18 to 2025-12-20)
**Issue**: Multiple PRs (#137, #139, #138, #141) had red flags with failing deployments on both Vercel and Cloudflare Workers
**Root Causes**: Build compatibility, deployment configuration conflicts, merge conflicts between PRs, and platform-specific deployment issues
**Solution Applied**: 
- Systematic troubleshooting of build, schema, and deployment pipeline
- Cherry-picked critical fixes between PR branches to resolve conflicts
- Implemented incremental testing and validation approach
- Platform issue analysis for documentation-only PRs with deployment failures
**Key Insights**: 
- Address root causes systematically rather than symptom patches
- Critical fixes must be propagated to all affected PRs
- Schema validation is fundamental to deployment success
- Platform deployment issues can occur independently of code quality
- Documentation-only PRs should be evaluated independently of platform failures

### PR #138 Resolution Strategy (2025-12-19)
**Issue**: PR #138 had extensive merge conflicts across 80+ files with unrelated histories
**Root Cause**: PR branch diverged significantly from main, creating incompatible merge states
**Solution Applied**:
- Analyzed PR content and identified that critical fixes already exist in main branch
- Confirmed build and deployment functionality on main branch
- Documented PR #138 as obsolete - no merge required
**Key Insight**: Not all red-flag PRs need merging; sometimes main branch already contains necessary fixes

### PR #141 Documentation Update - Platform Issue Analysis (2025-12-20)
**Issue**: PR #141 had Vercel/Cloudflare deployment failures despite correct code functionality
**Root Cause**: Platform-specific deployment environment issues, not code-related problems
**Solution Applied**:
- Verified local build works perfectly (`npm run build` succeeds)
- Confirmed no TypeScript errors or merge conflicts
- Documented comprehensive analysis showing PR is mergeable
- Added recommendation to merge despite platform failures
**Key Insight**: Platform deployment failures can occur independently of code quality; documentation-only changes should be evaluated on code correctness, not deployment status

### Recommended Development Patterns

#### Browser Compatibility Checklist
- [ ] Verify all imports work in browser environment
- [ ] Avoid Node.js-specific modules (`crypto`, `fs`, `path`, etc.)
- [ ] Use Web APIs or browser-compatible alternatives
- [ ] Test build process after adding new dependencies

#### Error Handling Strategy
- **Current**: Build-blocking errors must be resolved immediately
- **Priority**: Critical > High > Medium > Low
- **Critical Impact**: Build failures, security vulnerabilities, data loss
- **Approach**: Fix first, optimize later

#### Module Design Principles
1. **Cross-Platform First**: Always target browser environment
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Provide fallbacks when possible
3. **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript typing preferred
4. **Single Responsibility**: Each utility should have one clear purpose

## Agent Guidelines for Future Work

### When Addressing Bugs
1. **Verify Build Impact**: Always run `npm run build` to check for breaking changes
2. **Type Check**: Use `npm run typecheck` to catch TypeScript issues
3. **Lint Quality**: Address critical lint issues but prioritize function over form
4. **Document**: Record root cause, solution, and prevention strategies

### When Managing PRs with Red Flags
1. **Conflict Resolution**: Merge main branch into PR branch to resolve merge conflicts
2. **Schema Validation**: Verify vercel.json complies with current Vercel schema requirements
3. **Build Testing**: Ensure local build passes before pushing changes
4. **Incremental Pushes**: Push small changes and allow deployment systems to complete
5. **Monitor Status**: Use `gh pr checks` to track deployment status and identify specific failures
6. **Cross-PR Propagation**: Critical fixes must be cherry-picked to all affected PR branches
7. **Documentation**: Update AGENTS.md, bug.md, and task.md with resolution details for future reference
### When Optimizing Features
1. **Measure First**: Use bundle analysis before and after changes
2. **User Impact**: Prioritize visible improvements over internal optimizations
3. **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain existing APIs where possible
4. **Testing**: Verify optimization doesn't break existing functionality

### When Improving Code Quality
1. **Incremental**: Fix issues in logical groups rather than random scatter
2. **Context-Aware**: Understand file purpose before changing patterns
3. **Consistent**: Follow existing conventions unless clearly problematic
4. **Document Changes**: Update relevant documentation files

## Future Agent Tasks

### Immediate (Next Sprint)
- Address high-impact ESLint warnings
- Implement bundle splitting for performance
- Add unit tests for critical utilities

### Short Term (Next Month)
- Upgrade to Web Crypto API for security
- Comprehensive lint cleanup
- Performance optimization pass

### Long Term
- Enhanced error boundary coverage
- Component refactoring for maintainability
- Advanced testing strategy implementation

## Development Workflow Recommendations

1. **Start with Build Check**: Always verify build works before major changes
2. **Test Incrementally**: Run type checking and linting during development  
3. **Document Decisions**: Record why changes were made, not just what was changed
4. **Think Cross-Platform**: Consider browser, server, and edge environments
5. **Security Mindset**: Validate inputs, avoid exposing secrets, use secure defaults

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Build Compatibility
- **Issue**: Node.js modules in frontend code
- **Solution**: Use browser-compatible alternatives or Web APIs
- **Detection**: Build failures with module resolution errors

### Deployment Configuration
- **Issue**: Platform schema validation failures
- **Solution**: Review platform documentation and remove deprecated properties
- **Detection**: Deployment logs show validation errors

- **Solution**: Incremental cleanup with focus on critical issues
- **Detection**: `npm run lint` shows extensive warnings

## Multi-PR Conflict Resolution Strategy

### Scenario Overview
When multiple PRs have interdependent fixes with deployment failures:
1. **Identify Root Causes**: Distinguish between build, schema, and merge conflict issues
2. **Prioritize Critical Fixes**: Build-blocking issues take precedence over optimization PRs
3. **Branch Management**: Use cherry-pick to transfer fixes between PR branches
4. **Validation Process**: Test build+typecheck after each fix integration

### Success Indicators
- All deployments show "pending" or "pass" status instead of immediate failure
- Local build and typecheck pass consistently
- No merge conflicts remain
- Schema validation compliant across all platforms

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Build passes without errors
- ✅ Type checking passes
- ✅ Deployment pipelines functional
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility maintained
- ✅ No regressions introduced
- ✅ Documentation updated
